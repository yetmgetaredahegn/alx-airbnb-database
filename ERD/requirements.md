## âœ… Notes
- Passwords are stored as **hashes**, not plaintext.  
- Roles differentiate **hosts**, **guests**, and **admins**.  
- Booking status ensures proper tracking of reservations.  
- Payments are always linked to a booking.  
- Messages are self-referencing and allow users to communicate with each other.
